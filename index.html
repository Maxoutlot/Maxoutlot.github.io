        <h2>First week in Xian</h2>
        <p>The first week has been exosting in Xi'an. Changing your work and place to live in a short period of time is difficult in itself but it also happened suddenly. Teaching was great though I was given too many classes. I hate dealing with documents transfer and everything that's related to it. Now that I'm settling down propertly I have some time to wtire this blog post. Need to get to know people otherwise it's too boring.</p>

        <p>Tomorrow I'll fly to Xi'an. That's a new city and a new chapter in my life. I'll be blogging here about my expirience.</p>
